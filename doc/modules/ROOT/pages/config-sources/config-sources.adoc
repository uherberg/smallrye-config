= Config Sources

SmallRye Config provides a few enhancements and extensions to MicroProfile Config `ConfigSource`.

== Config Source Factory

Another way to create a `ConfigSource` is via the `ConfigSourceFactory`. The difference between the SmallRye Factory
and the standard way to create a `ConfigSource` as specified in MicroProfile Config, is the Factory ability to provide
a context with access to the available configuration. With the `ConfigSourceFactory` it is possible to bootstrap a
`ConfigSource` that configures itself with other `ConfigSources`

By implementing https://github.com/smallrye/smallrye-config/blob/master/implementation/src/main/java/io/smallrye/config/ConfigSourceFactoryjava[ConfigSourceFactory], the ConfigSource is made available via the
`ConfigSource getConfigSource(ConfigSourceContext context)` method. The `ConfigSourceFactory` can be also assigned a
priority, like any other `ConfigSource` by overriding the method `OptionalInt getPriority()`.

When the Factory is initializing, the provided `ConfigSourceContext` may call a single method
`ConfigValue getValue(String name)`. This method lookups configuration names in all `ConfigSources` that are already
initialized by the `Config` even if they have a lower priority than the one defined in the `ConfigSourceFactory`. A
`ConfigSource` produced by a `ConfigSourceFactory` is not taken into account to configure other sources produced by
lower priority `ConfigSourceFactory`.

Registration of a `ConfigSourceFactory` is done via the `ServiceLoader` mechanism by providing the
implementation classes in a `META-INF/services/io.smallrye.config.ConfigSourceFactory` file. Alternatively, factories
may be registered via the Programmatic API in `SmallRyeConfigBuilder#withSources`.

== Available Config Sources
In addition to the default Config Sources specified by MicroProfile Config (Environment Variables, System Properties
and `microprofile-config.properties` file), SmallRye Config provides the following additional Sources:

* <<properties-config-source>>
* <<configvalueproperties-config-source>>
* <<filesystem-config-source>>
* <<hocon-config-source>>
* <<yaml-config-source>>
* <<zookeeper-config-source>>
* <<aws-appconfig-config-source>>
